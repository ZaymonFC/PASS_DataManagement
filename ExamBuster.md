### Partial Key
Weak entities cannot be uniquely identified without
knowing information about the parent entity. A partial 
key is the combination of the parent entities primary 
key and some identifying attribute/s of the weak entity.
	
### M:M Mapping:
Create a new table with the primary keys of both entities
in the relationship. Then include any attributes of the
relationship.

### Weak Entities
A weak entity is an entity that cannot exists without the
presence of its related strong entity.

### ER Mapping Unary Relationships
Use standard binary mapping rules as if you were maping
the entity to a copy of itself

### What is data redundancy
Data redundancy is a condition created within a database or
data storage technology in which the same piece of data is
held in two separate places. 

### Inference Rules
##### Reflexivity
- If B is a subset of A, then A -> B
##### Augmentation
- If A->B, then A,C->B,C
##### Transitivity
- If A->B and B->C, then A->C
