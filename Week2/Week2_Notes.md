# Week 2 Notes
## What is data?
- Meaninful facts
- Describing entities
- Example: Name, tel, address, email ... ect.
- Entities can be something abstract like an order (Not always tangible)
- Every entity has multiple properties
#### Data can be facts about _relationships_
- Attributes about the relationship

### Data vs Information
- Data is raw and unprocessed
- Information is useful info found from the data

## The Database
- A database is a collection of __logically related__ data
- Includes descriptions of the data called _meta data_
- Logically related data comprised of entities, attributes and relationships

## The DBMS
- Stands for _Database management system_
- Enables user to define, create, maintain and control access to the __db__
- You can compare the DBMS to an operating system - which extends the functionality of a database

### Functions of a DBMS
| Function Name | Description |

### Disadvantages of database
- Complexity
- Actual cost of the DBMS
- Hardware costs
- Performance
- High impact of failure

### Database System

- DBMS is like a layer between _application programs_ and the data base

### How to Manage Data?
- Traditionally each program defines and manages its own data
    - What are some drawbacks by doing this?
        - Redundancy
        - Higher space complexity
        - Slower/incomplete queries
        - Data can be left in an inconsistent state easily
        - Application program tightly coupled with the data
    - Conversely what are the benefits of a DBMS?

## The Database Approach
- Indexing can make queries much faster
- Data is shared between all applications
- Facilitates the building of application
- Enforce standards
