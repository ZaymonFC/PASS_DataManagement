### Knowledge Questions
- What is a __partial key__? Where do you find them in an ERD?
- What do you do when mapping __M:M relations__ to tables?
- What are __weak entities__?
- What are the two kinds of subclasses? Why are they separated like this?
- How do we apply ER Mapping rules to __unary relationships__?
- In many cases tables with the same primary key can be merged. Can you think of an example when this would be a good solution?
- Do you include __derived attributes__ when mapping an entity to a table?
