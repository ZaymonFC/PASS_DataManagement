Hello friends and family
We're here to celebrate the birthday of my father, and while it's not actually his birthday today when you've been alive for that long no-one really notices if you round up a little bit. Half a century you've been with us today, and for last 40% of that I've been able to spend it with you. Now I can't really speak about your younger days I feel relatively qualified to speak from the heart about the last stretch. Whether its teaching me to tie my shoes, ride a bike or swim out the back of the breakers and make all the life savers nervous you've always been there for me. Mike, (dad) is a man who gives his heart and his time to his friends and family. I'm sure many of you  have had a few run-ins with our family handyman, and he's definitely bailed me out of a few shoddy attempts at craftsmanship. Even though sometimes you're grumpy and you're still trying to comprehend why any son would stay in bed past the hour of 9am when there's trees to be chopped, furniture to be moved, half a metric tonne of leaves to rake and a new appliance to install, I am glad and proud to call you my father. You've been such an influence in my life and I am looking forward to journey into adulthood with such a wonderful father like you.
